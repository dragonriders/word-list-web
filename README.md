## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.jsÂ®,  and Angular CLI.

### Node.js
Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x.
* To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.
* To get Node.js, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

### Install the Angular CLI
You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.
Install the Angular CLI globally
To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:
``` 
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Develop
* Getting Started
    * Clone the project  [word-list-web](https://github.com/dragonriders/word-list-web.git) using
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/dragonriders/word-list-web.git 
    ```
    * After cloning the project, switch to project directory i.e word-list-web using command
    ```
    cd word-list-web
    ```
    * Install the dependencies of the application using command
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    * To start the application run the command (make sure your current directory is 'word-list-web' to run the application)  
    ```
    ng serve --open
    ```
* Development server
    * Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

* Code scaffolding
    * Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

* Build
    * Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

* Running unit tests
    * Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

* Running end-to-end tests
    * Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
